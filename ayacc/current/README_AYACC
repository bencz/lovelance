     - go to ayacc directory
     - run "gnatmake ayacc"
     - move the executable in a reachable directory

## USAGE

$ ayacc file.y

Generated files: file.a pascal_tokens.ads pascal_shift_reduce.ads pascal_goto.ads
and file_error_report.a if error recovery is on
Use .a files in GNAT with gnatchop
